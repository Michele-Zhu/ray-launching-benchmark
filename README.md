# Digital Twins of the Electromagnetic Environment: Benchmark for Ray Launching Models


Evaluation scenarios
-----
In order to receive the processed scenarios (stl and xlm format) and transceiver positions, please kindly compile the form in [[link](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=K3EXCvNtXUKAjjCd8ope67HRsXFs9_dAh1RssQC73HxUOElEQTFCUTcxVzhLVTNFUEhXUUFSRkFTNi4u)]. In case of problems, please write us an e-mail. stl does not contain materials descriptions, while xlm file already have mesh material included.
